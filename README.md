📊 Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker – Power BI Dashboard

📝 Overview
In this project, I designed a Professional, Interactive Marketing Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to evaluate the performance of a social media ad campaign (e.g., Facebook/Instagram). The goal of this dashboard is to help marketing teams and decision-makers understand:
📈 How well did the ad campaign perform?
📅 When did ad engagement peak during the campaign?
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Which age and gender groups had the most conversions?
💸 How efficient was the campaign in terms of ROI and CPC?
This task challenged me to go beyond basic visuals and dive deep into marketing analytics, KPI tracking, and dynamic filtering using Power BI.

🧠 Skills Gained
✅ Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
✅ Marketing KPI Analysis (CTR, CPC, ROI)
✅ DAX Calculations for New Metrics
✅ Time-Based Performance Tracking
✅ Building Interactive Dashboards in Power BI
✅ Insightful Business Storytelling through Data

🛠 Tools Used
Power BI Desktop – for DAX calculations, visualizations, and dashboard creation
Microsoft Excel – for minor data review and structure
Power Query Editor – for cleaning and transforming data inside Power BI

📂 Dataset Used
I used a cleaned and enhanced version of the campaign data:
💾 cleaned_campaign.csv – includes fields like Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Spend, Age, Gender, and Ad ID.
🧮 Additional Calculated Fields:
CTR (Click Through Rate)
CPC (Cost Per Click)
Revenue (assumed ₹50 per conversion)
ROI (Return on Investment)

📈 Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard includes:
📊 KPI Cards: Total Clicks, Spend, Impressions, Revenue, CTR, CPC, ROI
📅 Line Charts: CTR, Spend, and ROI trends over campaign dates
🎯 Bar Chart: Top-performing ads based on approved conversions
👫 Pie Charts: Conversion distribution by Gender and Age Group
🔻 Funnel/Stacked Chart: Impressions → Clicks → Conversions
🔘 Interactive Slicers: Filter by Age, Gender, and Date

🎯 Business Insights
Some actionable insights extracted:
🔝 Ads targeting age group 45–49 had the highest conversions
💰 Highest ROI occurred in the second half of the campaign
🎯 Male users had higher engagement rates
📅 Campaign activity spiked around August 24th
